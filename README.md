# Covid Detection Using CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based project that predicts whether an input image belongs to the "Covid" or "Normal" category. The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images to identify signs of Covid-19.

## Project Structure

- **`Covid_or_not.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow for training and testing the CNN model.
- **Dataset**: A collection of images organized in two folders:
  - `Cov` (for images of Covid cases)
  - `Nor` (for images of normal cases)
